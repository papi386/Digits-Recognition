*****Digit Recognition Project***** <br> <br>
This repository focuses on digit recognition using deep learning techniques. It provides a comprehensive introduction to various neural network models and visualization techniques for understanding digit data.<br><br>

*****Project Contents***** <br> <br>
***Visualization Functions:*** <br> The project includes different functions to visualize the digits, allowing users to easily understand the dataset and see how the models interpret the data.<br><br>

***Neural Network Model***:<br> A neural network model using Dense layers is implemented, providing a foundation for understanding basic neural network structures and how they process input data.<br><br>

Convolutional Neural Network Model:<br> A more advanced model is developed using Convolutional layers combined with Dense layers. This model takes advantage of spatial hierarchies in the data, making it suitable for image recognition tasks.<br><br>

***Logits Technique***:<br> Both models utilize the logits technique for improved mathematical accuracy. This technique helps in better interpreting the model outputs, facilitating more effective decision-making in digit classification.<br><br>
